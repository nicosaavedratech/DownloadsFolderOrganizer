# DownloadsFolderOrganizer
Script to organize folders by the extension of the files.

We can organize the files that we have in a folder depending on the extension they have.
Ideal for automating the "downloads" folder of our OS user.

Steps:

A: The script checks if the folders where the files will be sent exist, if not found, it creates them.

B: The extensions of all files are checked one by one.

C: The different types of files are moved depending on whether they are documents, photos, videos, music or others
file types.
